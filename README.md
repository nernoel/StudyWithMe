# StudyWithMe
<p>Study with me is a student collaborative application where students are able to find a study partner. The goal is that students will always have someone to study with when needed and can post to find someone who they can study with!</p>

# 💡 Reasons for building application
<p>Being a student in college it's not always the easiest thing to find a study partner. Sometimes finding a study partner for things such as an upcoming exam, or upcoming quiz can be difficult even for me which brought me the to the idea of StudyWithMe where it can be used to make it easier to find a new study partner via post. By creating a post you can show you are actively looking for another student to collab with and study with! </p>

# 🛠️ Bugs and future updates
The app currently needs some UI fixes and polishes to the UI & UX design, and am currently working on those. All functionality is working but would like to include more features such as more user authentication options (currently limited to Google auth).

# 📺 Demo
Demo is coming soon...
